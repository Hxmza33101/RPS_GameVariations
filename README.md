A program that plays Rock, Paper, Scissors, Lizard, Spock. Completed for an assigned project for Eng1000.

The RPSLS_Game_Project.c is the main program, it has the base RPSLS game within.

The rps7.c is the first extension, it entails editting the code so that it works with a different version of the game, rps7 which is the same game, except with a total of 7 different gesture inputs.

The file Extension2.c is the second extension. We were tasked with writing an algorithm that could be changed easily, without having to write a massive if block to determine the winner.
